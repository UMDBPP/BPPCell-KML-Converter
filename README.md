# BPPCell-KML-Converter
Program to convert GPS data from BPPCell into a KML file that can be plotted in Google Earth.

This program converts Cell Tracker (github.com/umdbpp/bppcell) data into a KML flight path suitable for analysis in Google Earth. It is written in C#, so the repository is the Visual Studio project. For best results, clone the project with Visual Studio's built-in Git facilities and buid the project in Visual Studio. The result should be a command-line executable that takes in the raw CSV's and generates a KML output file.
